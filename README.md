For ITIL Process Documentation:

Explained the purpose, goals, and scope of ISM — ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of sensitive patient data.

Outlined benefits for both IT service providers (stronger client trust, compliance, fewer breaches) and customers (better service quality, legal assurance).

Defined key roles and responsibilities — including the CISO, IT Security Manager, Incident Response Team, and Process Owner.

Identified Critical Success Factors (CSFs) such as continuous risk assessment, employee training, incident response, and executive commitment.

Specified Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) like incident response time, disaster recovery effectiveness, and compliance levels.

Added key security definitions (ISMS, PHI, PII, CIA Triad, encryption, risk assessment, compliance).

For Statistical Analysis:

Generated and analyzed the dataset by calculating response durations (in milliseconds) between request and response timestamps.

Visualized data using histograms and box-and-whisker plots (via Matplotlib and Seaborn) to show the distribution and range of command durations.

Calculated statistical parameters — mean and variance — for each command type, assuming a Normal Distribution N(μ, σ²).

Detected and removed outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method and re-plotted the results to show cleaner data distributions.

Commands analyzed included: GetDeliveryAddress, GetPaymentList, AddItemToOrder, GetTrackingData, GetItemList, ModifyItem, SetPayment, ModifyOrder, Login, and GetOrder.
